# Diagnostic-Systems
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the diagnosis of breast cancer using a dataset of patients tested with a fine needle aspirate (FNA). The dataset, wdbc.pkl, includes statistics of 10 different cell features for each patient, along with a diagnosis (malignant or benign).

The notebook implements and evaluates three classifiers for diagnosing breast cancer:

A rule-based classifier that interprets abnormal cell size, shape, texture, and homogeneity as indicative of malignancy.
A Random Forest classifier implemented using the sklearn framework.
A Guassian Navie Bayes classifier implemented using the sklearn framework.
The performance of these classifiers is compared, and their interpretability is discussed.
